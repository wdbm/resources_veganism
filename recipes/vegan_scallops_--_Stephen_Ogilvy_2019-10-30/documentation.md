## Marinade

- juice of 3/4 lemon
- 300% of the above quantity soy sauce
- 1/2 teaspoon dill
- salt and pepper
- add nori or the like if possible

Combine all ingredients and mix.

## Garlic butter

- half carton of soy butter
- 6-7 large cloves of garlic
- quarter cup parsley
- 1/4 tspn black pepper
- dash of neutral oil

1. Heat the oil with a tablespoon of the butter in a saucepan at low-medium heat.
2. Add cloves until lightly cooked through, but not browned.
3. Add rest of butter until melted. Cook for another few minutes on current heat and add the parsely and black pepper.
4. Turn to lowest heat until ready to serve scallops. If the butter is still evaporating at this heat, turn off heat but leave on hob.

## Scallops

- one block silken tofu
- quarter cup chives and parsely

1. Take one block silken tofu and cut into 1.5 inch rectangles, off roughly half that height.
2. Combine marinade ingredients in a container and carefully transfer silken tofu blocks to the marinade.
3. Leave for around 2 hours while basting the tofu, as opposed to flipping to preserve the tofu's integrity.
4. Prepare a pan with a generous covering of neutral oil on a medium-high heat (4.5/6 on Elien/Liam's cooker).
5. Transfer the marinaded pieces to the pan carefully, one by one, using a flat spatula and a chopstick.
6. Turn after around 3 to 4 minutes, or when the cooked side has begun to lightly brown. If sticking add more oil or lower heat.
7. Once both sides are cooked, remove scallops from pan and drain excess oil on kitchen roll.
8. Serve scallops with a covering of garlic butter and a small garnish of the chives and parsely.
