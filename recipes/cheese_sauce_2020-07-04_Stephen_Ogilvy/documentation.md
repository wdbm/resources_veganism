You want a smashing one you do the following:

Sift some flour, use it to make a roux with some vegan milk butter and olive oil. If there are any hard bits or chunks after incorporating then you pass the roux through the sieve.

Fry up some garlic puree in olive oil, add some celery salt, cayenne, paprika.

Grate a whole block of the Asda smoked applewood vegan OR use a whole pack of the violife grated.

Add the roux to the garlic and spices, then stir in your cheese until melted.

At the end add some fresh chopped parsley and chives.

It is done. Best served with a big pot of macaroni or penne
