<https://www.thebuddhistchef.com/recipe/seitan> with:

- onion powder -> almost pureed onions/shallots, add to dry mix
- soy sauce *= 2/3
- Add a bunch of cumin
- Add a bunch of pureed garlic
- (Optional) add a skoosh of liquid smoke
- (Optional) sub gram flour for more gluten if you like a more rubbery texture
- *important* use about 40% of the stated hot water as it's massively overestimated and will drown your mix. Add more as needed
- I multiply all quantities by 5 and that's enough to use 1.25kg of gluten which is half of one of the 2.5kg bags you can order online. It's also enough seitan for maybe a month of moderate usage.
- Also I cook that for between 1 (relatively chewy) and 2 (harder - good for fake doner) hours
- (I should say moderate usage for 3, I'm sure it's abundant for a solo endeavour. It freezes well)
