Seitan is a fantastic meat alternative. Made from protein-rich wheat gluten, it is both tasty and nutritious. You can do just about anything with seitan from sandwiches to stir fries and this recipe is the best I have ever made. If you're concerned about heating up plastic wrap, you can skip this step, it is mainly to help the seitan keep its shape. Or use BPA and phthalates free, microwave safe plastic wrap.

- 2 cups vital wheat gluten 250 g -- you might have to add a little more depending on the brand
- 1/2 cup chickpea / garbanzo bean flour 50 g
- 1/2 cup nutritional yeast  30 g
- 1 tablespoon smoked paprika
- 1 tablespoon dried basil
- 1 tablespoon onion powder
- 1 tablespoon ketchup
- 2 tablespoons vegan worcestershire  sauce
- 1/2 cup soy sauce 125 mL
- 1 1/2 cups hot water 375 mL
- 4 cups vegetable broth 1 L

- 1. In a large bowl, combine vital wheat gluten, chickpea flour, nutritional yeast, smoked paprika, dried basil, and onion powder. Set aside.
- 2. In another bowl, whisk together ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, and 1 Â½ cups (375 mL) hot water.
- 3. Add wet mixture to dry ingredients and stir until mixture has a dough-like consistency.
- 4. Knead for 2 to 3 minutes, adding more vital gluten wheat if dough is very sticky.
- 5. Roll in plastic wrap and tie a knot at each end, leaving 1 inch (2 cm) at both ends to allow dough to expand.
- 6. Bring vegetable broth to a boil in a large pot.
- 7. Carefully place plastic-wrapped seitan in boiling broth. Cover, return to a boil and reduce heat to low.
- 8. Continue simmering until firm, turning seitan occasionally, about 1 hour.
- 9. Remove from heat and let seitan cool 15 minutes in broth.
- 10. Cut off knots at either end and remove plastic wrapping. Slice seitan before serving.
