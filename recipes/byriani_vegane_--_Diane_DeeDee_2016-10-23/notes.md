Will Breaden Madden This looks delicious. Was there a particular recipe that was followed?

Diane DeeDee I followed 2 recipes to make up this one ;) I can give you the recipe if you have Indien spices without which it won't be good at all because of the back eyed beans

Diane DeeDee For 6 persons (6 lunches for me): one cup of cooked black eyed beans, 2 (or more) fresh carrots cut in cubes and roasted in a pan with 1 spoon (when the color changes a little bot it's done) of oil, in a pan you roast in the oil of your choice some fresh gram masala (look at any indien recipes in tube video) then add one chopped oignon... Once the oignon is translucide add once chopped carlic (or 1tsp of carlic+ginger paste) the spices you like (I used one tsp of each curry and tumeric). Keep the heat in medium heat and wait a min to cook these spices (if it burns start all over again). Then add 2 fresh tomatoes in cubes (or more to taste) and the carrots, mix it all then add 1tsp of each: ginger (I don't have ginger paste so optional for you), cumin, black pepper and cardamon (+ chili or any hot pepper to taste). Let it cook... then add one cup of green peas (optional), the cooked black eyed beans (without its cooking water) + 1tsp of gram masala mix it all and turn off the heat, add one cane of coco cream and mix it all . 2 cup of very nice Himalayan basmati rice to soap in cold water (add salt at the surface like for pasta or even more) of only 20 min. Follow this link for the rice: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEgH2csGA7w (I added one small cinnamon stick + 2 bay leaves + 2 whole cloves + 2 tsp of cumin grains to the water to boil for the rice... once I add the rice, i boil it for 3 to 4 min time to get the grains as long as possible) then soak the rice. Put the sauce in your rice cooker and keep it in medium to high heat and cover it with the rice quickly, add 2 tsp of oil at the surface of the rice (you can also add chopped mint and coriander) and close the cooker to contain the steam inside (if the cover has a hole, cover it with a clean tea towel)... let it for 2 to 5 min then as soon as you start to see steams coming out of the well closed cover put the heat to very low for 20 min and serve with a little bit of Cashew + dried raisin a little bit roasted in a pan and 1 tsp of oil... Bon appetit! You can add more vegetables like in the video : I put whatever I had :), for the rice my Indien experience showed that himalayan basmati rice is the best choice, while the black and brown rice are the worst specially if you already use beans... If you are in France, the long grain parfumed basmati rice is very delicious (in purple box)...

Diane DeeDee Deepak Kar Ok let's say I usually mix up the sauce with rice and cook it, but this time I put the sauce in the bottom and covered it with rice and cooked for 20 min with steam inside (for Byriani you put the meat and the sauce in the bottom)... so let's say I cooked it following the byriani style :)
