[According to UN research](http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3437e.pdf), the animal industry accounts for ~14.5 % of *all* human-made greenhouse gas emissions. Note that this is slighly more than **all** of the global exhaust exissions of trains, planes and automobiles, and ships, [according to the Royal Institute of International Fairs (Chatham House)](https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/publications/research/CHHJ3820%20Diet%20and%20climate%20change%2018.11.15_WEB_NEW.pdf) (see page 55), who themselves report those numbers from research of the UN and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IGPCC). The Chatham House further reports (via two references) that humans who don't take animal products produce about **half** or the greenhouse gases of those who do [[ref](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2016/03/16/1523119113.full.pdf)].

Put in other words: If you want to SAVE LIVES (like 8 fucking million human apes over the next 30 years) then:

**The Most Significant, Impactful thing, a thing that you can do with you live is plausiblly to become vegan.**
